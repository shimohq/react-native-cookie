* expires
Specifies the Date object to be the value for the Expires Set-Cookie attribute. By default, no expiration is set, and most clients will consider this a "non-persistent cookie" and will delete it on a condition like exiting a web browser application.

* path
Specifies the value for the Path Set-Cookie attribute. By default, the path is considered the "default path". By default, no maximum age is set, and most clients will consider this a "non-persistent cookie" and will delete it on a condition like exiting a web browser application

```javascript
// set cookie 'foo=bar' for 'http://bing.com/'
Cookie.set('http://bing.com/', 'foo', 'bar').then(() => console.log('success'));

// set cookie 'foo=bar' for 'http://bing.com/' with options:
Cookie.set('http://bing.com/', 'foo', 'bar', {
